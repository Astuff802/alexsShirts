        I've been making shirts for as long as my fine motor skills would allow
        me. I remember creating my first fine art shirt when I was 6. One could
        say it rivaled Michelangelo's style. Ever since I've been throwing
        myself at my work, tireless in my craft in making the best fashion and
        apparel in the entire universe (yes universe, I've checked), so please,
        if you will browse my store, I can guarantee that you will either find
        something that compels you to buy it, or you are in dire need of an
        optometrist.
